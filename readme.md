## 1. Download and Set Up CS2 Dumper
Download the CS2 Dumper (https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/releases).
Extract the .exe file and place it in the folder with the name "cs2_dumper".

## 2. Start CS2 in Insecure Mode
Launch CS2 with the -insecure mode enabled. This ensures that you won't get banned.

## 3. Run CS2 Dumper
Open the cs2-dumper.exe file from the cs2_dumper folder.

## 4. Close CS2 and Restart Normally
After running the dumper, close CS2.
You can now restart the game in normal mode and use the hack.

## 5. Using the Menu
Once in the game, use the hack menu.
Press F8 to run the menu in the background when you're done so you can't interact with it further.

## Updating Offsets
If the offsets are broken, press the "Update Offset" button.
It's better to perform this update in -insecure mode, but you are unlikely to be banned if you don't.
Sometimes you have to download a newer version of the dumper.
